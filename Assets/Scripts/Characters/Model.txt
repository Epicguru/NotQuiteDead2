
A plan on how the characters will be controlled and networked.
(A character is a human-like entity that can handle items and navigate the world)

Characters have 'manipulators' which essentially own the characters, and indicate that they are in control, but beyond that they do not
actually have any solid control implementation. Meaning that they own and manage the character but do not implement any control or AI directly.
